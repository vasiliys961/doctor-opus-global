# 📘 Doctor Opus — Physician User Guide

> **Important:** Doctor Opus is a Clinical Decision Support System (CDSS) for **licensed healthcare professionals only**. It is not FDA-approved and does not constitute a medical diagnosis. All AI-generated outputs require independent clinical verification. You bear full responsibility for all clinical decisions.

Doctor Opus accelerates your clinical workflow by providing AI-assisted interpretation of medical imaging, lab data, genetic reports, and clinical notes. Each section contains contextual tips — review them on first use.

The application runs on desktop and mobile. Both can work independently or in tandem via the cross-device sync module.

## 🤖 AI Assistant

The core intelligence of the platform. Supports open-ended clinical dialogue, case discussion, differential diagnosis, literature review, and multi-file analysis.

**Available models (dropdown):**
- **GPT-5.2** — Best for 80% of imaging, MRI, and general clinical questions. Concise and efficient.
- **Claude Opus 4.6** — Deepest reasoning. Best for complex cases, genetics, and rare pathologies. Slower, higher cost.
- **Claude Sonnet 4.6** — Balanced. Excellent for quick consultations and fracture assessment.
- **Gemini 3.1 Flash** — Fastest. Ideal for quick reference and data extraction.

**The assistant can:**
- Answer clinical questions and sustain multi-turn dialogue
- Accept results exported from any other section
- Specialize as a consultant (Cardiologist, Neurologist, Orthopedist, etc.)
- Perform literature review and evidence-based searches
- Process uploaded files (images, PDFs, Word documents)
- Use your **Personal Library** (RAG) — when enabled, the assistant draws answers from your own uploaded PDF guidelines and references

**PHI reminder:** Do not enter patient names, dates of birth, or other identifying information in the chat. Use anonymized descriptions (e.g., *"65 y.o. male, smoker, 3-week cough"*).

---

## 📚 Personal Library (RAG)

Upload your own PDF clinical guidelines, textbooks, and atlases. Once processed, the AI Assistant can search them and cite relevant excerpts directly in the analysis output.

- Capacity: up to ~1 GB (larger collections may slow the browser on low-end hardware)
- Files are processed on your **local server** — not sent to external services
- Use text-searchable PDFs (not scans) for best results

## 📝 Clinical Protocol (Voice-to-Note)

Converts unstructured dictation or typed notes into a structured, specialty-specific clinical note — ready to download as a **Word (.docx)** file, edit, and sign.

### How to use
1. Select your **specialty** from the dropdown (Cardiology, Neurology, Orthopedics, etc.)
2. Dictate or type the encounter notes in any order — the AI structures them automatically
3. Click **Generate Protocol** — the formatted note appears in the right panel
